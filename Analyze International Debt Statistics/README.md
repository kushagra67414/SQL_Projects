Let's Start the Project

## Task-1

* The World Bank's international debt data
```
Inspect the international debt data.

Read the line of code provided for you, which connects you to the international_debt database.
Select all of the columns from the international_debt table and limit the output to the first 10 rows.
Good to know
The only prerequisite to complete this project is familiarity with the contents covered in DataCamp's Intro to SQL for Data Science course.

SQL DataCamp projects are completed in Jupyter Notebooks. If you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, that's okay! All you need to know is that you can execute SQL commands in the code cells provided, as long as you have %%sql at the top of them. If you'd like more info on Jupyter Notebooks, go here.

If you experience odd behavior you can reset the project by clicking the circular arrow in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Resetting the project will discard all code you have written so be sure to save it offline first.
```

## Task-2
* Finding the number of distinct countries
```
Find the number of distinct countries.

Use the DISTINCT clause and the COUNT() function in pair on the country_name column.
Alias the resulting column as total_distinct_countries.
Jupyter Notebook trick: if you click the white area to the left of the output for this task's code cell, the output area will be collapsed and become scrollable.
